      <p> New referral feature on LinkedIn for individuals to refer their
connections to open jobs or to network, eliminating the need for cold email introductions and closing gaps in the "forgot to follow up" category by allowing referrants to make real-time automated connections.

        <h3> Research </h3>
        <p>•	As one of the few teams with a UX Designer, our team was ahead of the curve when it came to empathizing with our user base by including a persona.
We were the only team to include a specific, detailed persona within our planning and pitch. Our persona guided how we developed the product to ensure the feature was meeting our users' needs.</p><br>
<p>Persona: Yasmin is a mother of a two, who is looking to get back to work now that her youngest is 6months old. Cold emailing hiring managers hasn’t resulted in any job leads.
She has a network, but she needs a foot in the door. LinkedIn’s Refer feature allows her connection, Derek, to refer Yasmin to a hiring manager. Within seconds she is warmly connected to Sabrina, another of Derek’s contacts.

      <h3> Ideation </h3>
      <p> Our group went through multiple rounds of ideation in planning the business strategy and feature sets that we could accomplish within 24 hours. Using our design thinking criteria, we determined a feature would be more desirable, viable, and feasible for our team to complete.</p><br>
      <p>With the refer button, users can navigate to an individual’s LinkedIn page and click refer. Users are then prompted to complete a simple drop down form to refer the job seeker to a network connection. After submitting the form, LinkedIn connects the referral and the connection with an automated message.

      <h3> Wireframe </h3>
      <p>As UX lead, I made a first draft mock-up in approximately 5 minutes to help our team visualize the solution we had just ideated together.
We also used this proof-of-concept mock-up to gain feedback from our stakeholders, the mentors and hackathon organizers, we connected with over the weekend.

      <h3> Design </h3>
      <p> LinkedIn already has an established brand and design pattern, but the exact form we needed to create did not yet exist.
I pulled artifacts from existing LinkedIn assets such as posts and form fields to design our referral form module within the same patterns.
I also researched <a href="https://brand.linkedin.com/en-us">LinkedIn’s Branding Guidelines</a> to ensure our design was consistent and could be easily adopted by LinkedIn as a new feature.

      <h3> Prototype </h3>
      <p>Pulling together my assets, I designed a vector to recreate the user icon.
LinkedIn’s user icon, from their brand guidelines, is exactly like the i from their logo. Next I established buttons, form fields, and a full recreation of the messaging platform.
My interactive prototype served as a guide for our developers in coding the project.

      <h2> Conclusion </h2>
      <p>Throughout the project, our stretch goal was to integrate the refer feature within Linkedin’s existing “Open to Work” feature. Merging with the current user flow on LinkedIn, a user would be prompted when they select they are Open to Work with the option to toggle on referrals. When selected, the Refer button would automatically be added to the user's profile.</p><br>
<p>In the next iteration I would add a form field asking the referent how they know the user being referred with drop down options or write-in text. This aspect would be to emphasize actual connections referring one another rather than someone referring a user they don’t fully know.</p><br>
<p>Our team’s next steps given the time and resources would be to create a Chrome extension that would allow users to utilize the Refer button on LinkedIn. We would promote the extension at upcoming events to reach the 75% adoption rate and 60% increase in new hires by 6 months, and use this data to pitch the feature to LinkedIn.</p>
