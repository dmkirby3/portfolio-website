      <p>The Becoming Counseling needed a redesign of their landing page user experience in preparation for a national parnership with the Hall of Fame Behavioral Health. This partnership would expand The Becoming's counseling services from local to Nashville, TN to a nation-wide service delivery. Given the 2-week turnaround, and as the only UX Designer, I rapidly engaged in the Design process to conduct competitor research and iterate on wireframes and paperprototypes.

<h3> Research </h3>
        <p>I conducted a comparative analysis to understand what users were familiar with in tele-health therapy companies.
Mental Health laws vary by state, and tele-health laws even more so, but a user shouldn’t have to be a law expert to know if they can meet with a therapist. When a site was upfront about its services being national, it was easier for the user to understand they could use the services no matter their state or city location.
</p>
<p>Finding a therapist is hard. Finding a good fit for a therapist is even harder. Services that promote a custom, matching feature for their users reduce friction and barriers and help jumpstart a user straight into their user flow.
Initially, The Becoming did not include any of these features on their website nor promote that they had a matching feature available.

      </picture>
      <h3> Ideation </h3>
      <p>One of the takeaways from my competitive analysis was that several therapy tech companies had an immediate tagline to help the user know who they are and where they offer services.
    </p>
<p>After a few iterative sketches, I landed on a tagline of:
“Flexible Counseling & Coaching. Tailored to You. Your Goals. Your Needs.”
<p><br>
  <p>For this project, users needed a way to immediately understand who The Becoming is and what services they offer, but the original copy was vague and didn’t speak to users directly.
  </p>
<p>Before, the copy emphasis was on:
</p>
  <ul>
<li>Telehealth Services<li>
<li>Counseling Services<li>
<li>Locations Across Middle Tennessee <li>
</ul>


<p> After the ux writing improvements the focus was on:
</p>
  <ul>
<li>Flexible Services</li>
<li>Accessible Services</li>
<li>Nation-Wide services</li>
<li>Personalized Matches</li>
<li>Widening services to include coaching</li>
</ul>

        <img src="img/becoming/wireframe@2.png" alt="Wireframe">
      </picture>
      <h3> Wireframe </h3>
      <p>•	Rapid wireframing meant I could preview multiple iterations in a short amount of time. I wanted to highlight the users' ability to be matched with a therapist or coach with an accompanying action, so I renamed the "Our Therapists" page to “Find a Therapist”. This would ultimatly prove to be too long for the menu header and wasn't inclusive of the coaching services, so I ended with "Therapists and Coaches".</p><br>
<p>One of the main features of The Becoming Counseling was the ability to match a user to the right provider for them, but our website didn’t adequately reflect that we offer that service.
I rewrote the site copy so that the very first sentence a user would read would take the stress off of them and immediately reduce friction- ”We’ll match you with one of our licensed clinicians…so you can spend your time focusing on you.”
</p>

      </picture>
      <h3> Design </h3>
      <p>While the two week deadline for this project did not allow for visual design edits, user experience edits I was able to make include the following:
      </p>
<ul>
  <li>Updated the main page heading from a vague statement about life being hard to a description of available service offering.<li>
    <li>Developed a brand tagline to solidify The Becoming's brand and services."<li>
    <li>Shifted opening paragrah copy from descriptive service explaination to a user-focused tone, addressing the user directly.<li>
<li>Redirected the user journey from starting with a location page to directly engaging with the therapist and coaches. I did so by reordering the Locations page to nest under the About navigation header, and making the Therapists and Coaches page both the location for the CTA button on the landing page and the primary link in the menu navigation.<li>
  <li>Rewrote the website banner to better reflect the national service provision. The site banner originally said, “now seeing clients via Telehealth,” to mark a shift from in-person services only. I went through a few iterations of sayings that would flow in tandem to our new tagline to help eager users know immediately who we serve and chose, “Private, Accessible Care In-Person & Online.”<li>
</ul>

      </picture>
      <h3> Prototype </h3>
      <p>I worked directly with the marketing lead and team on this project, and with the rapid turnaround needed, it was not necessary to built out a full digital prototype. Instead, I built a paper prototype using the wireframes I designed, and handed those off to the marketing team and web developer to implement.

      <h2> Conclusion </h2>
      <p>After improvements in the user experience and brand identity, The Becoming Counseling's website features a national focus for the nation-wide services it could now provide, simpler menu navigation that kept the focus on the user's connection with their therapist and coach, and brand expansion showcasing how The Becoming matches users with a provider to reduce barriers and friction.</p><br>
<p>Though, not essential at the time, I also included suggestions for second iteration edits that would include a search feature on the Therapist and Coaches page. A search feature would allow users to preview their provider options before making an initial outreach, even allowing users to filter their serach by state, treatment need, and therapy or coaching type.
