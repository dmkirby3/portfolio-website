          <p>Being unfamiliar with the product, an informative website for Spiritual Direction services, I conducted a comparative analysis to:

              <li>All websites included the practitioner’s qualifications and training, which established trust and credibility right away </li>
              <li>I was more drawn to the websites that easily explained what the services would be for me as a user</li>
              <li>Websites that included resources or free content helped me experience first-hand what spiritual direction might feel like</li>

      <h3> Ideation </h3>
      <p>What I learned from my user interviews is that when users seek Spiritual Direction services they are often in a low point in life, or they are looking to grow and build what they already have.
      </p><br>
      <p>Users needed the website to convey these opposing user needs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users may want to grow their relationship with Spirituality</li>
        <li>Users may be confused about their beliefs</li>
        <li>Users may feel stuck or struggle with their faith</li>
        <li>Users may be curious or want to explore faith</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Building user types or personas into the site, gives users a starting point to know they are in the right place even though the reasons that brought them to spiritual direction may be vast and varied.

      <h3> Wireframe </h3>
      <p>Users are often unfamiliar with Spiritual Direction services, so
        I built the user flow right into the website to help reduce friction and barriers for new users.</p>

      </picture>
      <h3> Design </h3>
      <p> Though I started with a simple sketch to get the landing page flow, building the website in Squarespace provided the opportunity to make rapid changes for my freelance client after stakeholder reviews with her. I also led a branding meeting
        to guide my client in the imagery, tone, and voice she wanted for her site. We agreed on nature imagery that showcased both the light and the darkness that can be part of Spiritual Direction services.

        <img src="img/pdirection/resources@2.png" alt="Resources">
      </picture>
      <h3> Prototype </h3>
      <p>While this project didn't call for a formal low-high fidelity prototyping phase, the priamry stakeholder and I reviewed all website copy, imagery, formatting, and branding over 4 design reviews. However, an aspect I included in my client's
        website (originally prompted by my comparative analysis) that I am especially proud of is the Resources page.
      </p><br>
      <p>Drawing on the senses, users are encouraged on the Resource page to create a comfortable setting and read through the calming, meditative resource to then share at their first session. Users don’t have to wait for an appointment to
        experience a taste of what the product could add to their life; they can start right now in their own home.
      </p><br>
      <p>As of March 2022, the resources page has the second highest page views, next to the main home page. </p>

      <!-- whole section block that holds the conclusion -->
      <h2> Conclusion </h2>
      <p>My roles for this project were UX Researcher, UX/UI Designer, and Brand Designer from June to August 2021. Throughout the project I was able to accomplish the following goals that were set in the intial meeting with my client.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have a visual website to send to potential clients (did not want lead generation)</li>
        <li>Increase client understanding of services</li>
        <li>Establish brand identity and credibility for practitioner</li>
        <li>Curate appropriate referrals by informing user of practitioner’s target audience</li>
        <li>Create a way to centralize and professionalize practitioner’s communication flow</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While, I am "on-call" for as needed edits, where I would take this project next given the time and resources would be to review the Google analytics and marketing analysis of the website and conducting usability research to determine if
        users are finding the information they need and understanding the product of Spiritual Direction.</p>
